[*] 10.129.2.63 - Collecting local exploits for x86/windows...
[*] 10.129.2.63 - 38 exploit checks are being tried...
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d: The service is running, but could not be validated.
  This module will create a new session with SYSTEM privileges via the 
  KiTrap0D exploit by Tavis Ormandy. If the session in use is already 
  elevated then the exploit will not run. The module relies on 
  kitrap0d.x86.dll, and is not supported on x64 editions of Windows.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms14_058_track_popup_menu: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  This module exploits a NULL Pointer Dereference in win32k.sys, the 
  vulnerability can be triggered through the use of TrackPopupMenu. 
  Under special conditions, the NULL pointer dereference can be abused 
  on xxxSendMessageTimeout to achieve arbitrary code execution. This 
  module has been tested successfully on Windows XP SP3, Windows 2003 
  SP2, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 2008 32bits. Also on Windows 7 SP1 
  and Windows 2008 R2 SP1 64 bits.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms14_070_tcpip_ioctl: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  A vulnerability within the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol driver 
  tcpip.sys can allow a local attacker to trigger a NULL pointer 
  dereference by using a specially crafted IOCTL. This flaw can be 
  abused to elevate privileges to SYSTEM.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms15_051_client_copy_image: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  This module exploits improper object handling in the win32k.sys 
  kernel mode driver. This module has been tested on vulnerable builds 
  of Windows 7 x64 and x86, and Windows 2008 R2 SP1 x64.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms16_016_webdav: The service is running, but could not be validated.
  This module exploits the vulnerability in mrxdav.sys described by 
  MS16-016. The module will spawn a process on the target system and 
  elevate its privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM before executing the 
  specified payload within the context of the elevated process.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ms16_075_reflection: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  Module utilizes the Net-NTLMv2 reflection between DCOM/RPC to 
  achieve a SYSTEM handle for elevation of privilege. Currently the 
  module does not spawn as SYSTEM, however once achieving a shell, one 
  can easily use incognito to impersonate the token.
[+] 10.129.2.63 - exploit/windows/local/ppr_flatten_rec: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  This module exploits a vulnerability on EPATHOBJ::pprFlattenRec due 
  to the usage of uninitialized data which allows to corrupt memory. 
  At the moment, the module has been tested successfully on Windows XP 
  SP3, Windows 2003 SP1, and Windows 7 SP1.
