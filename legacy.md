```
well,let's break down the scan  results.

we can see standard ports on which smb operates on open(135,445)

along with that the aggressive detection on nmap gives us the os of the system can be - Microsoft Windows XP SP3 (94%)

I searched the exploit for microsoft windows xp and found that we can use  ms08-067 which is available on metasploit

which translates to the CVE [exploit](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2008-4250/)

so firing up metasploit and searching gives us.....

![metasploit]("Images/metasploit-legacy.PNG")

setting options to the appropriate one's and firing off the exploit gives us a meterpreter session.

![session]("/Images/session-legacy.PNG")

now executing getuid on this session gives that we are NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

Done :)
